    "    2. The first character of a variable name must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "    3. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

While Python doesn't enforce strict rules for variable naming, the community generally adheres to a set of conventions outlined in PEP 8, the Python Enhancement Proposal for code style.\n",

   "source": [
    "i) Use Descriptive Names:\n",
    "    Variable names should be meaningful and describe the purpose of the variable. This makes the code more self-explanatory.\n",
    "        Good: total_count, user_name, average_temperature\n",
    "        Avoid: x, temp, var1\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Use lowercase letters:\n",
    "    Variable names should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores (snake_case). This convention is standard for most variables.\n",
    "        Good: my_variable, word_list, max_value\n",
    "        Avoid: CamelCase, MixedCase, PascalCase\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Constants:\n",
    "    Constants, which are variables with values that should not be changed, are typically written in ALL_CAPS with underscores separating words.\n",
    "        Example: PI = 3.14159, MAX_VALUE = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Avoid Using Single Letters:\n",
    "    Avoid using single-letter variable names except for loop counters (e.g., i, j, k for loops). Even in loops, try to use more meaningful names if possible.\n",
    "Exception: x, y, and z are commonly used as coordinates in mathematics and graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) Module-Level Constants:\n",
    "    If you need module-level constants (variables that are accessible across multiple files), consider using uppercase names with module-level scope.\n",
    "Example: CONFIG_FILE = \"config.ini\"\n",
    "\n",
    "vi) Private Variables:\n",
    "    Variables that should not be accessed directly outside a class or module are often prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _private_variable). This is a convention to indicate that the variable is intended for internal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's crucial to be consistent with your naming style throughout your codebase. If you start with snake_case for variables, stick with it. If you choose CamelCase for class names, maintain that style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and clarity should be prioritized over brevity. It's better to have longer, descriptive names than cryptic or overly abbreviated ones.\n",
    "By following these naming standards and conventions, we can create Python code that is more understandable and maintainable, which is crucial when working on collaborative projects or revisiting your own code in the future."
